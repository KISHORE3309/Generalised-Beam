# Generalised-Beam
It is a generalised beam MATLAB Code yields displacement, slope, load vectors at all nodes.
to make it user friendly separate function file is used for every process like input file, boundary conditions, post processing etc.
graph was plotted at the end for displacement vs x, slope vs x
